=head1 NAME

Data::YAML - Easy YAML serialisation of Perl data structures

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Data::YAML version 0.0.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In the spirit of L<YAML::Tiny>, L<Data::YAML::Reader> and
L<Data::YAML::Writer> provide lightweight, dependency-free YAML
handling. While C<YAML::Tiny> is designed principally for working with
configuration files C<Data::YAML> concentrates on the transparent round-
tripping of YAML serialized Perl data structures.

As an example of why this distinction matters consider that
C<YAML::Tiny> doesn't handle hashes with keys containing non-printable
characters. This is fine for configuration files but likely to cause
problems when handling arbitrary Perl data structures. C<Data::YAML>
handles exotic hash keys correctly.

The syntax accepted by C<Data::YAML> is a subset of YAML. Specifically
it is the same subset of YAML that L<Data::YAML::Writer> produces. See
L<Data::YAML> for more information.

=head2 YAML syntax

Although YAML appears to be a simple language the entire YAML
specification is huge. C<Data::YAML> implements a small subset of the
complete syntax trading completeness for compactness and simplicity.
This restricted syntax is known (to me at least) as 'YAMLish'.

These examples demonstrates the full range of supported syntax. 

All YAML documents must begin with '---' and end with a line
containing '...'.

    --- Simple scalar
    ...

Unprintable characters are represented using standard escapes in double
quoted strings.

    --- "\t\x01\x02\n"
    ...

Array and hashes are represented thusly

    ---
      - "This"
      - "is"
      - "an"
      - "array"
    ...

    ---
      This: is
      a: hash
    ...

Structures may nest arbitrarily

    ---
      -
        name: 'Hash one'
        value: 1
      -
        name: 'Hash two'
        value: 2
    ...

Undef is a tilde

    --- ~
    ...

=head2 Uses

Use C<Data::YAML> may be used any time you need to freeze and thaw Perl
data structures into a human readable format. The output from
C<Data::YAML::Writer> should be readable by any YAML parser.

C<Data::YAML> was originally written to allow machine-readable
diagnostic information to be passed from test scripts to
L<TAP::Harness>. That means that if you're writing a testing system that
needs to output TAP version 13 or later syntax you might find
C<Data::YAML> useful.
